## 👨‍💻 About Me

I'm a Computer Science major at Texas Tech University and an AI Fellow in the Break Through Tech AI program hosted by Cornell Tech. Through this year-long fellowship, I'm developing real-world machine learning skills using Python, scikit-learn, and modern AI development tools.

I'm currently building a strong foundation in supervised learning, model evaluation, and responsible AI practices. Over the coming months, I’ll be creating clean, well-documented machine learning projects that reflect my growth as an early-career AI engineer.
